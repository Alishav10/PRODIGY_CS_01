# Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool - Task 1
This is Task 1 of my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
##  What It Does
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
For example:
- Original: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`
This project allows users to:
- Enter a message and shift value
- Encrypt or decrypt using the Caesar Cipher logic
## Technologies Used
- Python
## Task Details
